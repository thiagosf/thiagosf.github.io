## About These Instructions

**What you're receiving:**
- Finished UI designs (React components with full styling)
- Data model definitions (TypeScript types and sample data)
- UI/UX specifications (user flows, requirements, screenshots)
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Test-writing instructions for each section (for TDD approach)

**What you need to build:**
- Backend API endpoints and database schema
- Authentication and authorization
- Data fetching and state management
- Business logic and validation
- Integration of the provided UI components with real data

**Important guidelines:**
- **DO NOT** redesign or restyle the provided components — use them as-is
- **DO** wire up the callback props to your routing and API calls
- **DO** replace sample data with real data from your backend
- **DO** implement proper error handling and loading states
- **DO** implement empty states when no records exist (first-time users, after deletions)
- **DO** use test-driven development — write tests first using `tests.md` instructions
- The components are props-based and ready to integrate — focus on the backend and data layer

## Goal

Set up the foundational elements: design tokens, data model types, routing structure, and application shell.

## What to Implement

### 1. Design Tokens

Configure your styling system with these tokens:

- See `product-plan/design-system/tokens.css` for CSS custom properties
- See `product-plan/design-system/tailwind-colors.md` for Tailwind configuration
- See `product-plan/design-system/fonts.md` for Google Fonts setup

### 2. Data Model Types

Create TypeScript interfaces for your core entities:

- See `product-plan/data-model/types.ts` for interface definitions
- See `product-plan/data-model/README.md` for entity relationships

### 3. Routing Structure

Create placeholder routes for each section:

- `/` — Hero Section
- `/experience` — Experience Section
- `/projects` — Projects Section
- `/playground` — Playground Section
- `/contact` — Contact Section

### 4. Application Shell

Copy the shell components from `product-plan/shell/components/` to your project:

- `AppShell.tsx` — Main layout wrapper
- `BackgroundEffect.tsx` — Global background animation context

**Wire Up Navigation:**

Connect navigation to your routing:
- Home (Hero)
- Experience
- Projects
- Playground
- Contact

## Files to Reference

- `product-plan/design-system/` — Design tokens
- `product-plan/data-model/` — Type definitions
- `product-plan/shell/README.md` — Shell design intent
- `product-plan/shell/components/` — Shell React components

## Done When

- [ ] Design tokens are configured
- [ ] Data model types are defined
- [ ] Routes exist for all sections (can be placeholder pages)
- [ ] Shell renders with background effects
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
